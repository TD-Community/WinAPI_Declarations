**************** WinAPI32 Declarations ANSI & UNICODE ****************

VERSION 1.10	17-11-2015

**** DESCRIPTION ****

This set of libraries contain Windows API function declarations and constants.
Specific ANSI (A) and UNICODE (W) implementations are present.

To use ANSI: WinApi32A.apl
To use UNICODE: WinApi32W.apl


These libraries are part of the archive:

- WinApi32A.apl -> Main library for all ANSI WinApi declarations
- WinApi32W.apl -> Main library for all UNICODE WinApi declarations. Only usable starting from TD51
- WinApi32_All.apl -> Main library which includes all A and W. Only usable starting from TD51
- WinApi32_Functions_A.apl -> ANSI specific function declarations (A)
- WinApi32_Functions_W.apl -> UNICODE specific function declarations (W). Only usable starting from TD51
- WinApi32_Functions.apl -> Shared function declarations, not specific to ANSI or UNICODE
- WinApi32_Functions_x64.apl -> API functions which are specially for x64 versions of TD
- WinApi32_Constants.apl -> Shared constants declarations, containing ANSI and UNICODE specific declarations
- WinApi32_CommonCtrlConstants.apl -> Shared common control constant declarations, containing ANSI and UNICODE specific declarations

Missing functions/constants will be added in future versions of this set.


**** USAGE ****

You can include the needed libraries in your projects.
But be aware of the remarks stated below.
Another option is to only take those API functions/constants you actually need. Copy/Paste them from the archive to
your own WinAPI library in use. This will be a more lean and clean method which will not increase the size and compile times of your projects.


**** REMARKS ****

When compiling the WinApi archive you might get compile errors.
Those are mainly caused by differences between Windows versions or different versions of the dll's.
Some functions or dll's are introduced in Win Vista or Windows 7/8 and are added to the archive.

Compiling on Windows XP or lower will get you compile errors on those functions or dll's.

Comment them out to fix this. If you want to use those functions on the system Windows OS which has compile errors actually mean you can not
use those features.

Here some examples:

GetFinalPathNameByHandleA and GetFinalPathNameByHandleW -> available starting from Windows Vista
dwmapi.dll -> available starting from Windows Vista. Probably is installed on older systems for specific Windows SP's

Compile errors on MSVCRT.DLL: this is a redistributable file (Microsoft runtime library) which exists in several versions depending on installed software, PATH settings etc.
When having compile errors, probably an older version of this dll is installed/found.

When having compile errors, you can check MSDN to see if a specific function or dll is present on the installed Windows OS you are using.

Beware that when you use windows API functions in projects, the userbase of you application determines if the function works or not.
So building applications calling specific API functions introduced in Windows 7 on your development system will fail when it is installed and used on a Windows XP system for instance.
Always check the availability of those API functions at client side, by determining which Windows OS systems they use.


**** REFERENCES ****

The documentation on Windows API can be found on MSDN.
There are a couple of "views" which list the API's differently

And Goooooogle is your friend in getting info and samples !!



**** CONTACT INFO ****

This archive is based on the several floating WinApi32 libraries out there in the wild.
It is enhanced with many more API functions and constants but it is surely not complete.

If you have API declarations which are not part of this archive, please collect them and send it in
as source files so it will be added in future versions of this archive.
This helps the community to have this archive more and more complete.
When you find issues or incorrect declarations, please report this.
